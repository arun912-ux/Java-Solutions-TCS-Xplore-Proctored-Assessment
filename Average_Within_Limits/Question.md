## Problem Statement

    Write main method in Solution class.

    In the main method, read five values for an integer array and two int value which are the limits(limit1 and limit2). The main method should pront the average of the integer values which are greater than limit1 anf less than limit2.

    For example if the values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the limits are 2 and 6 then the average is 4 ((3+4+5)/3). The output should be in the format of the sample output.

    Note: The returned value should be of an int data type.

## Input

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    2
    6

## Output

## Input

    100
    200
    300
    400
    500
    100
    500

## Output

    300

## Explanation

> Limits are 100 and 500, values between the limits are 200, 300, 400. Average of thoseque is 300.
